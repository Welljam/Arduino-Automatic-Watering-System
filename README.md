# Arduino-Automatic-Watering-System

This repository contains the code and documentation for my thesis project (Gymnasiearbete) on an automatic watering system.

## Overview

The automatic watering system is designed to monitor and control the watering of plants based on soil moisture levels. It consists of hardware components including sensor, relay, DC pump, a microcontroller and more, as well as software components responsible for data collection, processing, and decision-making.

## Features

- Monitoring of soil moisture levels
- Automatic watering based on preset thresholds
- Data logging using serial.print()

## Installation

To set up the Arduino Automatic Watering System, follow these steps:
 
Hardware Setup: Connect the various hardware components according to the provided circuit diagram. <br />
Software Installation: Upload the provided Arduino code to your microcontroller using the Arduino IDE. <br />
Configuration: Adjust the code parameters and thresholds as needed to suit your plant's requirements.

## Usage

Once installed and configured, the Arduino Automatic Watering System operates autonomously, continuously monitoring soil moisture levels and adjusting watering schedules accordingly. Users can monitor system performance and view logged data through the serial monitor interface.
